**I am actively seeking postdoc and industry research opportunities (including internships).**{: .notice--danger}
## About me
I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in [Purdue University’s Edwardson School of Industrial Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE), advised by [Prof. Vaneet Aggarwal](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~vaneet/). I completed an M.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at Purdue in 2025 (en route to my PhD), and I earned a B.E. in Electrical Engineering from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/page/539) in 2022.


My research centers on designing provably reliable algorithms for decision-making in stochastic systems; right now I’m focused on robust reinforcement learning and planning. My CV can be found [here](https://williamyangxu.github.io/files/William_Yang_Xu_CV.pdf).
